<h2>About</h2>
<p>
    The Soil Association is the only UK charity that works across the spectrum of human health, the environment and
    animal welfare. Its organic certification is widely regarded as the gold standard for all organic products and is
    very difficult to achieve. Every product in the Thistle Fields household and laundry range is certified organic with
    The Soil Association. This means that you can be assured that Thistle Fields products are made from organically
    farmed ingredients which are not genetically modified (GM) using no herbicides or synthetic fertilisers.
    <br>
    All Thistle Fields products are free from harsh chemicals, nano particles, parabens, synthetic dyes and artificial
    fragrances.

        <h3>Our Products are Organic</h3>
        <p>Many products can call themselves organic but that does not mean that they are 100% organic. In fact, very
            few products are 100% as they usually contain water and often non-organic ingredients such as synthetic
            fragrance, which is a common skin and respiratory irritant.<br>

            At Thistle Fields all our products are certified by UK certifying body, The Soil Association, which means that
            our workshop is regularly inspected, all our ingredients are approved by them as well as what we put on our
            labels and in our marketing material. You will find that other products may be certified by another body
            such as Ecocert who do not have such stringent conditions.</p>
